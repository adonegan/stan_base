                <p> If you were a teenager in the year 2000, you might remember Eminem's classic hit song and music
                    video Stan, featuring British singer Dido. "My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all..." - the song below inspired this app. Nearly 20 years on from the chilling video, to stan someone nowadays is less Stanley 'Stan' Mitchell and more superfan. This app is dedicated to the modern and completely harmless stan.
