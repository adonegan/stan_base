# StanBase

When I was 14 years old I saw the movie Heathers for the first time. It was an accident really; I was channel-hopping and randomly settled on the opening credits of the film. From the second I saw Winona Ryder I was hooked and when I was first introduced to Christian Slater I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

I was sad to see the film end and to cheer me up a friend from school gave me a printed IMDB list of all the movies Christian Slater starred in. I would spend the next few years hunting down his back catalog (pre-internet days!) and ticking each film watched off the list.

This is the inspiration for StanBase - it's a virtual list to tick off as you indulge in your favourite star's work. For this project, the focus is on Winona Ryder's film history. 

Why is the app called 'StanBase'? It's a database that super fans can add to. According to Urban Dictionary, a 'stan' is a crazed or obsessed fan and the term derives from the song Stan from Eminem. I feel the term encompasses those strong feelings of fandom and worship only the innocent fans of famous people know: the strong interest and admiration of someone's work and achievements.

## UX

The purpose of StanBase is to document the user's / users' quest to watch and document every film their star has made. 

This app is for film buffs, but could easily be used by music fans and other types of fans the world over as the ability add content is shared. StanBase is a place to build your own passion project and this project demonstrates my passion for the work on Winona Ryder.

Users of StanBase will have the ability to read, add, edit, update and delete films and information related to Winona Ryder's career.

## Deployment

I deployed this application using the Master Branch on hosting platform Heroku, which I did at the beginning of the project. Deploying at the beginning of the project instead of the end meant that I could preview the python programming language and flask during the project. Deploying to GitHub Pages was not an option this time because of the Python / Flask use within the project.

I deployed my project on Heroku by creating space for the app on my Heroku account, then adding a requirements.txt file and Procfile file to my project so Heroku could recognise the Python language. During setup, I logged in to Heroku using the Heroku command line interface. Though my source code is being added to a GitHub repository, I was still able to push content and deploy my project using git push heroku master.
